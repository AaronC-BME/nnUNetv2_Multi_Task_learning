# Technical Report for Deep Learning-based Pancreas Cancer Segmentation and Classification with nnUNetv2 Multi Task Learning
## Introduction

This report describes the development of a multi-task deep learning model for pancreas cancer segmentation and classification using 3D CT scans. The model leverages the nnUNetv2 framework, known for its state-of-the-art performance in biomedical image segmentation, with modifications to include a classification head. The primary objective is to achieve accurate segmentation of the pancreas and lesions, along with lesion subtype classification into three categories.
